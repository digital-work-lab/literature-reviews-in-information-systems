This encourages an understanding of the complexities, multiple interests and contextual factors that must be incorporated into the examination of LBS regulation in any social context. <jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Practical implications – Approximately 85 per cent of handsets now have a global positioning system chipset on board. LBS affect a great number of mobile users. This research will create awareness among users of the potential benefits and harms that can come from the (mis)use of the technology. It will also promote an awareness of the complexities surrounding LBS regulation, drawing attention to the importance of collaboration and involvement of LBS stakeholders in the regulatory process. <jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Originality/value – Defines the ethical dilemmas of LBS that influence regulatory choices through a review of applicable literature and proposes that future research simultaneously address technical, social and environmental factors relevant to LBS.",False,42,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Describing,en,,,narrative-review,,False,none,False,,True,True,Other Domain

Although health IT (HIT) has tremendous potential to improve quality and reduce costs in healthcare, significant challenges need to be overcome to fully realize this potential. In this commentary, we survey the landscape of existing studies on HIT to provide an overview of the current status of HIT research. We then identify three major areas that warrant further research: (1) HIT design, implementation, and meaningful use; (2) measurement and quantification of HIT payoff and impact; and (3) extending the traditional realm of HIT. We discuss specific research questions in each domain and suggest appropriate methods to approach them. We encourage information systems scholars to become active participants in the global discourse on health-care transformation through IT.",False,768,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,scoping-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,True,Other Domain

Specifically, this paper explores why and how issues of ontological foundation, training, equivalence of conceptual models, and modeling practices may result in differences between alternative modeling techniques.

Their main conclusion was that the majority of these articles did not properly conceptualize the IT artifact. They recommended that IS researchers start to theorize about the IT artifact and employ rich conceptualizations of IT. The Orlikowski and Iacono paper provides a strong anchor point from which to analyze the evolution of the IS discipline. In order to obtain an up-to-date image of contemporary IS research, and to assess how the IS field has evolved since the 1990s, we carried out a similar analysis on a more recent and broader set of articles, that is, the full set (N = 644) of papers published between 2006 and 2009 by six top North American (ISR, MISQ, JAIS) and European (JIT, ISJ, EJIS) journals. The statistics in our results reveal no drastic advance in terms of deeper engagement with the IT artifact; more than 39% of the articles in our set are virtually mute about the artifact, and less than 16% employ an ensemble view of IT. Moreover, we note differences among the North American and European journals. Implications of the findings for two perspectives central to the IS research legitimacy debate are discussed.",False,44,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Describing,en,,,descriptive-review,,False,none,False,,True,False,Other Domain

To enhance our understanding of IDB, we conducted a systematic review of existing literature, analyzing theories from the fields of criminology (e.g., Deterrence Theory), sociology (e.g., Social Control Theory), and psychology (e.g., Neutralization Techniques) utilized in IS research on IDB. We identified 46 theories from these disciplines, which we categorized into four main groups: psychological and behavioral, organizational, sociocultural, and decision-making. Additionally, we classified their constructs into eight key factors. Further, ten IDBs frequently studied in IS were identified. Our analysis identified relationships among these theories emphasizing shared concepts that improve our comprehension of IDB. These relationships and their implications for theory and practice are discussed offering insights into the multifaceted nature of insider deviance and the diverse theoretical lenses through which they can be examined. This review not only consolidates existing knowledge but also lays the groundwork for future research in effectively addressing insider deviant behavior.",,2,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis. The article sample to 2010 now includes 1466 articles from 16 journals. The analysis of the expectations yields mixed results for the DSS field. On the negative side, there has been an overall decline in DSS publishing, the relevance of DSS research published in journals to IT professionals has declined, and the rigor of DSS research designs has not improved. On the positive side, there has been improvement in relevance to managers, grant funding of DSS research has increased, there has been a positive shift in judgment and decision-making foundations, BI publishing has increased, and group support systems publishing has reduced to a more balanced level. An important result from the analysis of the last 7 years of DSS research is the significant increase in DSS design-science research (DSR) to almost half of published articles. It is clear from the analysis that DSS is undergoing a transition from a field based on statistical hypothesis testing and conceptual studies to one where DSR is the most popular method.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jitech/ArnottP14,cpid2:ffffffffffe00ffbffffffffc000007fc000003fc004023fc00fffffc21fffffc07fffffc4006bffc0ffffffc0ffffffcfffffffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc0001fffffffffffc7ffffffc0000003c0000003c0018003c0000003c0000003ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

First I identify three discourses on IS implementation and associated organizational and social change that coexist in information systems in developing countries (ISDC) research, namely as a process of technology and knowledge transfer and adaptation to local social conditions; as a process of socially embedded action; and as a process of transformative techno-organizational intervention associated with global politics and economics. I then point out the distinctive research agenda that has been formed in ISDC studies, both in the more familiar IS themes - failure, outsourcing, and strategic value of ICT - and also in studies of themes relevant specifically to the context of developing countries, such as the development of community ICT and information resources. Finally, I call the reader's attention to the potentially significant theoretical contributions of ISDC research for understanding IS innovation in relation to social context and in relation to socio-economic development theories and policies.",False,387,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,critical-review,,True,comprehensive,False,,True,False,Other Domain

As organizational processes are increasingly embedded within information systems, one of the key considerations of many business processes—organizational incentives—should become an important dimension of any information systems design and evaluation, which we categorize as the third dimension: incentive alignment. Incentive issues have become important in many IS areas, including distributed decision support systems (DSS), knowledge management, and e-business supply chain coordination. In this paper we outline why incentives are important in each of these areas and specify requirements for designing incentive-aligned information systems. We identify and define important unresolved problems along the incentive-alignment dimension of information systems and present a research agenda to address them.",False,190,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,True,Software Development

While the verb “to augment,” defined as a process to make something greater or more numerous, is often used in IS research, it lacks a discussion of what the targets of such a process could be. In other words: What is augmented? Our paper builds on the literature of five research disciplines in which augmentation is a particularly prevalent topic—i.e., computer science, information systems, economics, management, and philosophy. Accordingly, we identified four metanarratives that represent four distinct targets of AI-based augmentation—the body, cognition, work, and performance—that build on unique human-AI configurations and bring to the fore specific augmentation tensions. Using these insights, we formulate avenues for further IS research on AI-based augmentation.",,0,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/BaerWH25,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a state of affairs has been of great concern for the information systems discipline for decades, motivating information systems researchers to focus on and extensively study ISD project failure. However, the increasing complexity and uncertainty of ISD projects and contemporary system development processes are challenging ISD project failure scholarship. In this article, we ask the questions: What are the contributions and weaknesses of the extant ISD project failure/success literature? What are potential avenues to move the ISD literature forward? To answer these questions, first, we present a literature review that assesses research contributions within the major perspectives on ISD failure (i.e. rationalist, process and narrative). While the extant research within all perspectives make significant contributions to knowledge, we find that researchers remain preoccupied with ‘project failure’ as an end state of an ISD project. They pay little attention to problematic situations arising during ISD projects before they become failed projects. Based on the review and critique of the literature, we then argue that there is a significant benefit in extending research focus from ISD project failure to ‘ISD project distress’, which we define as a harmful project condition involving dynamic and fluid constellation of critical problems that are difficult to identify, understand and resolve. While ISD project distress is an increasingly perilous and consequential phenomenon, little is known about its nature and potential responses. Drawing from the sensemaking literature, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework for understanding the nature and sources of ISD project distress that provides a foundation for exploring early detection and timely response. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical relevance of the concept of ISD project distress and propose a corresponding research agenda.",,37,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Ackoff (1989) expressed concerns related to irrelevant information in his seminal work, but those concerns are not presented in the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) pyramid depicted by Debons et al. (1989), which is frequently cited in papers and textbooks. Moreover, although the DIKW pyramid outlines the path from data to wisdom, the emergence of technologies like big data and artificial intelligence (AI) has intensified research on misinformation, disinformation, and ignorance, which are overlooked in the DIKW pyramid. Furthermore, studies on sub-components of the hierarchy are in siloed pieces of literature. In this study, we conduct a multidisciplinary theoretical review, present a theory elaboration, and introduce a conditional probability framework for the information hierarchy. We employ a construct specification approach and a meta-synthesis to present a refined framework that more precisely represents the information hierarchy than the traditional DIKW pyramid and incorporates the implications of big data and AI. This novel theory elaboration study improves construct validity, scope, and understanding of the information hierarchy and its relevance in contemporary contexts.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, a synthesis of CPO extant studies is critical for both academics and practitioners to understand the CPO's tasks and responsibilities and how such a role leads to positive privacy-related organizational outcomes. This paper addresses a gap in the organizational information privacy literature by presenting a comprehensive and systematic literature review of the CPO role from 2000 to 2020. With the increasing recognition of CPOs' pivotal roles in enhancing information privacy practices across diverse sectors, this review aims to synthesize recent articles, identify research themes, pinpoint knowledge gaps, and propose avenues for future research. The study's contribution lies in providing a comprehensive literature review at the intersection of two main IS research streams: information privacy and IS leadership. We find limited research on information privacy that examines the CPO's role within relevant journals and conferences. The central theme that emerges from the literature is about identifying the CPO managerial roles, responsibilities, and background. We conclude by calling for more empirical research for a better understanding of the role and its impact.",,0,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/BantanS24,,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/BantanS24,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in information technology have raised concerns about information privacy and its impacts, and have motivated Information Systems researchers to explore information privacy issues, including technical solutions to address these concerns. In this paper, we inform researchers about the current state of information privacy research in IS through a critical analysis of the IS literature that considers information privacy as a key construct. The review of the literature reveals that information privacy is a multilevel concept, but rarely studied as such. We also find that information privacy research has been heavily reliant on student-based and USA-centric samples, which results in findings of limited generalizability. Information privacy research focuses on explaining and predicting theoretical contributions, with few studies in journal articles focusing on design and action contributions. We recommend that future research should consider different levels of analysis as well as multilevel effects of information privacy. We illustrate this with a multilevel framework for information privacy concerns. We call for research on information privacy to use a broader diversity of sampling populations, and for more design and action information privacy research to be published in journal articles that can result in IT artifacts for protection or control of information privacy.",False,842,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://misq.umn.edu/misq/article-pdf/35/4/1017/11397/10_belangercrossler.pdf,Understanding,en,,,critical-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,True,Security

This engagement state occurs when feeling connected to another actor or an object. In information systems (IS) research, engagement is recognized in the concept of ‘user engagement’, which has for many years successfully been employed to understand interaction patterns and user reactions. However, as IS artifacts evolve, we observe contemporary phenomena that are no longer covered by the existing concept: For one, IS have developed from passive resources (such as websites) to human-like actors (such as conversational, nowadays often large language model (LLM)-based, agents) so that a pure ‘user engagement’ perspective does not capture new affordances for engagement with active counterparts. Secondly, IS increasingly act as intermediaries into other engagement objects (e.g., organizations) that are the ultimate target of engagement. Thus, IS research may benefit from a broader perspective on engagement. Our work systematically draws on a structured literature review across adjacent academic disciplines and an in-depth qualitative analysis to develop a more comprehensive conceptual framework for engagement. With this framework, we contribute a refined and broadened conceptual base for engagement and discuss how it can inform future IS research.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/BenzRS24,,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/BenzRS24,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a structured literature review, we conceptualise CK and develop a formal definition, which is then evaluated using knowledge artefacts on different crowd-related platforms and differentiation criteria in relation to participants, context, purpose and process. The paper posits that CK is conceptually different from related concepts, due to its dynamic nature and its instantiation in the form of a CK knowledge artefact which requires a specific context and a unique knowledge-creation process. Furthermore, we discuss how the concept of CK and its associated artefact relates to established knowledge management concepts such as knowledge assets and the flow of CK in the epistemological differentiation of knowledge into tacit and explicit elements. The article contributes to the formal conceptualisation of crowd-based concepts and therefore improves understanding of existing implementations and supports the prudent design of future systems.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/BlesikBK22,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a conclusion is ironic because the theory has not been sufficiently and suitably replicated. It is possible that misspecifications in the various replications, applications, and extensions have led to the incorrect conclusion that UTAUT is more robust than it really is, leaving limited opportunities for future work. Although work on UTAUT has included important variables, predictors, and moderators, absent a faithful use of the original specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature of the effects of the original and additional variables. The present meta-analysis uses 25,619 effect sizes reported by 737,112 users in 1,935 independent samples to address this issue. Consequently, we develop a clear current state-of-the-art and revised UTAUT that extends the original theory with new endogenous mechanisms from different, other theories (i.e., technology compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, and costs of technology) and new moderating mechanisms to examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different contexts (e.g., technology type and national culture). Based on this revised UTAUT, we present a research agenda that can guide future research on the topic of technology adoption in general and UTAUT in particular.",,134,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/BlutCTV22,cpid2:fffffffffdfffffff87ffc0ff8400007fdc0000ffffffffffffffffff000000ffc00002ffe20187ffe00007ffc00003ffffffffffffe7ffffc00003ffc00003ffc00003ffc00003ffc00003ffc00003ffc0007fffc7ffffff000000ff07ffffff87f800ff001800ff001800ff7ff800ff007fffff7ffffffffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/BlutCTV22,,,eng,,,meta-analysis,,,,,,,,

Data was collected from 315 organizational users in India. The hypotheses draw on the theoretical underpinnings which have been statistically validated. Results show that CRM quality and satisfaction significantly influences an organization’s employees attitudes and intentions to use AI integrated CRM systems. The compatibility of CRM systems has, however, a limited impact on employees attitudes. The findings, which are aligned with the extended UTAUT model, provide useful insights into organizations and decision-makers for designing AI integrated CRM systems.",,112,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Socio-economic and geo-political implications, in addition to contemporary settings of information technology use, challenge the achievement of non-profit aims. Among others, interest in further investigation concerns DT-enabled change management and implementation regarding non-profit organizations (NPOs). Previous research started exploring the impact of DT processes on NPOs’ work. However, the characteristics of their DT processes remain unclear because of the diversity of social mission scopes. This paper contributes by examining the state of the art of the DT debate focused on NPOs. We propose a mixed-methods meta-synthesis for classifying and clustering the pertinent literature. We adopt a qualitative approach to identify a set of mutually exclusive dimensions summarizing the discourse and providing a taxonomy of the analyzed articles. Then, based on a quantitative approach, we investigate the relationships emerging from such classification and recognize clusters of articles sharing common characteristics. Beyond the results of the literature analysis, the main contribution of this work is a research agenda identifying issues and future directions. This study outlines three overarching directions in which NPOs foster specific DT initiatives: how, who, and what (to change) operating within a digitalized society.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, while past research has identified unexpected events as being an important aspect to consider when managing projects, the existing literature does not provide a clear conceptualization of this concept which limits the development of new theories and thus the ability to guide practitioners. Based on a literature review and to advance our understanding of unexpected events in IT projects and their effective management, and facilitate future theoretical developments on IT project management, the present paper develops a conceptualization that clearly distinguishes this concept from other closely related ones, as well as proposing a research framework that links it to IT project team responses and their consequences.

Modern organizations are immersed in data and are turning toward data science to address a variety of business problems. While numerous complex problems in science have become solvable through data science, not all scientific solutions are equally applicable to business. Many data-intensive business problems are situated in complex socio-political and behavioral contexts that still elude commonly used scientific methods. To what extent can such problems be addressed through data science? Does data science have any inherent blind spots in this regard? What types of business problems are likely to be addressed by data science in the near future, which will not, and why? We develop a conceptual framework to inform the application of data science in business. The framework draws on an extensive review of data science literature across four domains: data, method, interfaces, and cognition. We draw on Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety as theoretical principle. We conclude that data-scientific advances across the four domains, in aggregate, could constitute requisite variety for particular types of business problems. This explains why such problems can be fully or only partially addressed, solved, or automated through data science. We distinguish between situations that can be improved due to cross-domain compensatory effects, and problems where data science, at best, only contributes merely to better understanding of complex phenomena.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the tremendous failure costs, the challenges and causes of megaprojects' performance issues draw attention from project management practitioners and the research community. Information systems research explores technology’s role in shaping and transforming business and society. However, technology’s role in addressing megaproject performance is still under-researched, as evidenced by a search in the leading information systems (IS) journals. Among the emerging technologies, blockchain’s applicability in addressing challenges in megaproject performance is relevant for critical infrastructure development projects. The blockchain can potentially deliver cures to address megaproject challenges and their causes by synthesizing and analyzing evidence from literature across multiple contexts. We undertake three systematic literature reviews across ninety-eight prominent project management, IS, and construction project journals to understand megaproject problems and blockchain’s role in addressing similar problems in supply chain and procurement in projects. We propose a conceptual framework that describes how autonomy, agency, and enactment may shape blockchain’s role as an intervention in megaprojects to help researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners build a blockchain platform for megaproject supply chains. We also provide a research agenda concerning blockchain in the megaproject supply chain using the TCCM framework.",,0,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It uses the Burrell and Morgan framework as an intellectual map to analyse the socio‐philosophical concerns in various information systems and security approaches. The paper's contributions are in its analysis of trends in information systems and security research, the former in stressing the socio‐organizational perspectives and the latter in criticizing the preponderance of technical solutions. The paper also sets an agenda for a future research emphasis.",False,320,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,scoping-review,,False,partial,True,,True,False,Security

Indeed the field of outsourcing research has grown so fast that there has been scant opportunity for the research community to take a collective breath, and complete a global assessment of research activities to date. This paper seeks to address this need by exploring and synthesizing the academic literature on IS outsourcing. It offers a roadmap of the IS outsourcing literature, highlighting what has been done so far, how the work fits together under a common umbrella, and what the future directions might be. In order to adequately address the immense diversity of research on IS outsourcing and outsourcing in general, we develop a conceptual framework that helps us to categorize the literature. In particular, we look at the research objectives, methods used and theoretical foundations of the papers. In identifying the major research objectives, we view outsourcing as an organizational decision process and adapt Simon's stage model of decision making. This allows us to identify five major sourcing issues, from which at least one is covered by each academic article. These are the questions of why to outsource, what to outsource, which decision process to take, how to implement the sourcing decision, and what is the outcome of the sourcing decision. In analyzing the literature, we identify and structure the main explanatory factors and theoretical relationships within each of these sourcing stages. Based on our discussion of the research objectives, theoretical foundations and research approaches taken in the literature, we show how the various research streams hang together and we come up with a number of implications for research. Moreover, we identify a number of emerging sourcing issues. We believe that research on these ""new"" phenomena such as offshore outsourcing, application service providing and business process outsourcing would benefit from 'standing on the shoulders' of what has already been accomplished in the field of IS outsourcing.",False,699,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Outsourcing

Use cases were first proposed by Jacobson (1987) and have since been incorporated as one of the key modeling constructs in UML (Booch, Jacobson, & Rumbaugh, 1999) and the Unified Software Development Process (Jacobson, Booch, & Rumbaugh, 1999). This paper traces the development of use cases, and identifies a number of problems with both their application and theoretical underpinnings. From an application perspective, the use case concept is marked by a high degree of variety in the level of abstraction versus implementation detail advocated by various authors. In addition, use cases are promoted as a primary mechanism for identifying objects in an application, even though they focus on processes rather than objects. Moreover, there is an apparent inconsistency between the so-called naturalness of object models and the commonly held view that use cases should be the primary means of communicating and verifying requirements with users. From a theoretical standpoint, the introduction of implementation issues in use cases can be seen as prematurely anchoring the analysis to particular implementation decisions. In addition, the fragmentation of objects across use cases creates conceptual difficulties in developing a comprehensive class model from a set of use cases. Moreover, the role of categorization in human thinking suggests that class models may serve directly as a good mechanism for communicating and verifying application requirements with users. We conclude by outlining a framework for further empirical research to resolve issues raised in our analysis.",False,26,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,ng,,,critical-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Software Development

The theoretical explanations are particularistic and the empirical findings are fragmented and divergent. Managers and academics have thus had little guidance on how to explain and combat digital piracy. To help fill this gap, the present paper provides a meta-analysis that synthesizes past research and identifies the key drivers of users’ engagement in digital piracy. The findings identify new measures and revise existing strategies to confront the global threat of digital piracy. Effective anti-piracy measures focus on breaking habits, reducing users’ control, suppressing justifications, and changing attitudes. Breaking habits requires technical control strategies such as impeding access to pirate sites, and should be accompanied by legislative demands. Impairing the attractiveness of pirate websites while providing high quality content on legitimate channels weakens illegal users’ perceived control. Enhanced features and functionality of legal products and websites that are easy accessible strengthens legal users’ perceived control. While many existing anti-piracy campaigns foster positive appeals (e.g., supporting the industry), describing the risks and loss of control seem more promising. As for targeting, psychographics provide a better portrait of pirating users than demographics—they appreciate sharing, are innovative, less risk averse, less susceptible to influence, and of lower integrity. Finally, making more legal copies available to users is discouraged.",,48,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isr/Eisend19,cpid2:ffffffffe3ffe007e1fff807ffffffffc0000fffc3ffffffc001ffffc1c00007c0400007e0c00007edc00007ffc00007ffc00003ffc00007ffc001ffe800000fe3ff1007c1b58007e0018007c0018007c0018007c0018007e0018007e0018007e0018007e0018007c0018007e0018017e0018007e0018007ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,meta-analysis,,,,,,,,

Thus, the knowledgebase related to interaction with IAs has grown exponentially but remains segregated and impedes the advancement of the field. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature review to integrate empirical knowledge on user interaction with IAs. This is the first paper to examine 107 Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction papers and identified 389 relationships between design elements and user acceptance of IAs. Along the independent and dependent variables of these relationships, we span a research space model encompassing empirical research on designing for IA user acceptance. Further we contribute to theory, by presenting a research agenda along the dimensions of the research space, which shall be useful to both researchers and practitioners. This complements the past and present knowledge on designing for IA user acceptance with potential pathways into the future of IAs.",,47,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/ElshanZEJL22,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to AI in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. Nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage AI in their operations. The lack of a coherent understanding of how AI technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. This study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage AI technologies in their operations and elucidate the value-generating mechanisms. Our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of AI adoption and use; (2) the typologies of AI use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of AI. The paper concludes with an identification of the gaps in the literature and develops a research agenda that identifies areas that need to be addressed by future studies.",,552,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/EnholmPMK22,,rev_synthesized,TODO#EnholmPapagiannidisMikalefEtAl2022,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the only research appearing to investigate the phenomena consists of two prominent streams. A small number of case studies and experience reports that generally promote the success of XP in various development environments, and a well-established stream of research into pair programming has generated results that in part support the idea of XP. Research into AM appears to be even more sparse than that for XP. Case studies, comparative analyses, and experience reports comprise the majority of the research in the area, while very few empirical research efforts have been conducted. This article reviews the state of research in XP and AM, and recommends areas that could benefit from further study. Since nearly all empirical XP research relates to pair programming, a closer look into the unstudied XP core practices would be beneficial, although interaction between related core practice areas could confound such efforts. It might also be possible to group related core XP concepts and study the groups individually. Finally, there are those who claim that XP and AM, or even agility in general, are really nothing more than a repackaging of old concepts.

When uncertainty and irreversibility are high, concepts from real options should be used to properly structure the evaluation and management of investment opportunities, and thereby capture the value of managerial flexibility. However, while innovation researchers have posited that option value can influence the motivations of early adopters, and options researchers have identified emerging IT as a promising area for application of options valuation techniques, there has yet to be a systematic theoretical integration of work on IT innovation and real options. This paper seeks to fill this gap by developing a model of the determinants of option value associated with investments in innovative IT platforms. In so doing, the model addresses a central question in the innovation field: When should a firm take a lead role in innovation with emerging technologies? The analysis begins with an explanation of real options analysis and how it differs from conventional approaches for evaluating new technologies. Then a set of 12 factors—drawn from 4 complementary perspectives on organizational innovation (technology strategy, organizational learning, innovation bandwagons, and technology adaptation)—is synthesized into a model of the option value of IT platform investments. Rationales are provided to explain the direct effects of these factors on option value, and selected interactions among the factors are also considered. Finally, the implications of the model are presented in three areas: predicting IT platform initiation and adoption, valuing IT platform options, and managing IT platform implementation.",False,251,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Other Domain

Building on earlier research studies of task-technology fit (TTF) and other areas of IS, this article presents a three-step conceptual model to establish fit between managerial tasks, mobile IT, and the mobile use context, assuming that a good fit positively impacts task performance. We find that use situations characterized by high distraction and poor quality of network connection are particularly challenging for the design of mobile IS, and that the user Interface requires particular attention. Our model contributes to IS research by joining disparate streams of research in an effort to help advance our understanding about the development and utilization of mobile IS. From a practical perspective, we contribute to the success of mobile IS and to the effectiveness of mobile work as It becomes increasingly prevalent in our modern world.",False,118,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,none,False,,True,True,"Technology Acceptance, and Use"

Six digital libraries were searched, and 266 papers dealing specifically with the quality of UML models were identified and classified into five dimensions: type of model quality, type of evidence, type of research result, type of diagram, and research goal. The results indicate that most research focuses on semantic quality, with relatively little on semantic completeness; as such, this research examines new modeling methods vs. quality frameworks and metrics, as well as quality assurance vs. understanding quality issues. The results also indicate that more empirical research is needed to develop a theoretical understanding of conceptual model quality.

To examine the alignment paradox, we conducted a meta-analysis that probed the interrelationships between alignment, performance, and context constructs. We found the alignment dimensions (intellectual, operational, and cross-domain) demonstrate unique relationships with the different performance types (financial performance, productivity, and customer benefit) and with many of the other constructs in alignment’s nomological network. All mean corrected correlations between dimensions of alignment and dependent variables were positive and most of the credibility interval values in these analyses were also positive. Overall, the evidence gathered from the extant literature suggests there is not much of an alignment paradox. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying the relationships between alignment and performance outcomes and offering insight into sources of inconsistencies in alignment research. By doing so, this paper lays a foundation for more consistent treatment of alignment in future IT research.",True,178,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://misq.umn.edu/misq/article-pdf/38/4/1159/558/10_gerowgrover.pdf,Testing,en,,,meta-analysis,,False,partial,True,,True,False,IS Value

Major crises, like the pandemic, highlight the tremendous importance of the appropriate development of e-learning systems and its adoption and processes in organizations. Managers and employees who need efficient forms of training and learning flow within organizations do not have to gather in one place at the same time or to travel far away to attend courses. Contemporary affordances of e-learning systems allow users to perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling, as well as to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences that result in rich learning flows within organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic review of empirical studies at the intersection of e-learning and organizational learning in order to summarize the current findings and guide future research. Forty-seven peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. This survey identifies five major directions of the research on the confluence of e-learning and organizational learning during the last decade. Future research should leverage big data produced from the platforms and investigate how the incorporation of advanced learning technologies (e.g., learning analytics, personalized learning) can help increase organizational value.",,65,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/GiannakosMP22,,rev_synthesized,TODO#GiannakosMikalefPappas2022,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

This article aims at providing a systematic overview of the current state of the emerging research field of Universal Design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Emergency Management, and to highlight high-impact research opportunities to ensure that the increasing introduction of ICT in Emergency Management can contribute to removing barriers instead of adding more barriers, in particular for the elderly and people with disabilities. A systematic review on relevant literature on Universal Design, ICT and Emergency Management between 2008 and 2020 was employed using predefined frameworks, to answer the following questions: (1) Who are the target audiences (stakeholders) in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management in the different categories of Emergency Management ICT tools, and to what degree is Human-Centred Design and Universal Design taken into account? (2) What are the most important challenges and gaps in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency Management? We identify a set of gaps in the literature, indicating that there are some challenges where Universal Design is still limitedly addressed in technology development. We also derive promising future research topics based on areas that are missing in the literature.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/GjosaeterRC21,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their tremendous potential is a double-edged sword, and concerns about their malpractices and negative impact have risen remarkably. In the light of practical relevance, research on digital platform regulation (DPR) did not contribute very much. Especially information systems (IS) which, as a discipline, seems predestined to explain the problems at the confluence of technology–economy–society, has barely grazed the issue of DPR. Particularly, a contribution is missing that at least explores the problems with digital platforms systematically and comprehensively. In response to this aim, we pursue a two-step approach: First, we apply qualitative meta-analysis of 211 cases as well as a number of regulation papers and actual regulation endeavors to identify and conceptualize the problem scope and potential regulatory approaches for platform problems. Second, we condense our findings into a conceptual model. Our findings show that digital platforms exploit both platform- and monopoly-related problems to assert themselves in different markets. Through their impactful platform governance, they even have become serious challengers to the regulator in controlling market access, key conditions, and resources. At this, they rely on the efficient use of data and digital technologies to effectively orchestrate platform agents and their transactions. The outcome of the paper is a set of two structured instruments that fill a void in interdisciplinary research and provide support to DPR practitioners for a systematic approach to regulation.",,23,,,rev_synthesized,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02683962221146803,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

E-commerce technologies provide sellers with opportunities to design electronic mercantile mechanisms that reveal, conceal, bias, and distort market information, depending on their goals and market position (e.g., suppliers versus intermediaries). In particular, in information-intensive industries where electronic markets play an important role, many firms are using advanced technologies to put innovative strategies into play that are based on the provision of differential information to their customers. We examine the role of information transparency in electronic markets. We contend that there is an opportunity to develop research on sellers' strategies regarding information disclosure to customers and competitors. For that purpose, we develop a set of concepts and a framework to guide future research. We then propose an interdisciplinary agenda for research on the emerging and increasingly important topic of transparency strategy, which we define as the set of policies and decisions that a firm makes to disclose, conceal, bias, or distort market information.",False,144,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,scoping-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,True,E-Commerce

Yet despite its importance and centrality, the conceptualization of space in information systems is not as sophisticated or mature as in other fields. A lack of attention to the diversity of perspectives on space hampers ongoing research and the re-visioning of phenomena that could lead to new insights in information systems. The aim of this paper is to develop an encompassing framework that provides a comprehensive view of philosophical perspectives, spatial themes, and concepts of space that are relevant to information systems. As a result of an extensive literature review, an encompassing framework is presented that includes four prominent spatial themes: representing space, differentiating space, disclosing space, and intuitive space. Each theme is related to its key characteristics and features and underlying philosophical perspectives. The paper demonstrates how the new framework can facilitate IS scholars’ expansive analysis in scholarly work and assist editors and reviewers in evaluating papers concerning space in IS and shows how the re-visioning of phenomena can lead to transformational shifts in understanding IS phenomena.",,3,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/HajBolouriCG24,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

The last ten years of EUC research are characterised within an analysis of 16 studies, which demonstrates the variety of influences that researchers have postulated to contribute towards EUC success. Three distinct schools of thought are described. One school of thought of research is based on the contribution towards EUC success made by the behaviour of individuals, one is based on the characteristics of an end-user application, and another is based on the characteristics of the organization in which EUC occurs. The analysis provides researchers and practitioners with a road-map for defining and creating the conditions necessary for success with EUC. It is expected to assist future research in identifying gaps in current knowledge as well as facilitating a coherent progression of contribution to the field. Practitioners can use it to identify those factors that contribute most relevance to their achievement of success with EUC within their own contexts.

Hendriks2001,article,Many Rivers to Cross: From Ict to Knowledge Management Systems,"Hendriks, Paul H. J.",2001,Journal of Information Technology,,16,2,57--72,10.1080/02683960110054799,,,"Several applications of information and communication technology (ICT) have gained considerable popularity as instruments for knowledge management. Some authors even seem to equate knowledge management with the introduction of specific ICT applications (intranets, groupware, etc.). However, the relationship between ICT and knowledge is no less problematic. Organizational knowledge and ICT refer to distinct sets of conceptions and establishing their relationship is far from trivial. The question then is how to assess the relationship between ICT and knowledge management. Several variables to be considered when answering this question have been identified in the literature: the enabling role of ICT for knowledge processes, the state of the ICT infrastructure, the level of knowledge required for using ICT, other user considerations, etc. However, a more encompassing perspective connecting these individual variables seems to be lacking. The aim of the present paper is to correct this. It argues that five dimensions determine the potential value of ICT applications for knowledge management. These dimensions are summarized in the following question. How and when will ICT, in interplay with other knowledge management measures (dimension 5), help knowledge (dimension 2) as a dynamic (dimension 4), institutional and action-related resource (dimension 3) realize its strategic potential (dimension 1)? The main argument in this paper is that, unless all five dimensions are addressed together, no satisfactory assessment of the status of an ICT application as a potential tool for knowledge management is feasible. Each of these dimensions is of a complex, multidimensional nature. The identification of the five dimensions is therefore only a first step. It needs a follow-up in the form of an elaboration of each dimension. This paper provides the groundwork for such an elaboration.",False,47,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02683960110054799,Describing,en,,,narrative-review,,False,none,False,,True,False,Knowledge Management

This research has improved our understanding of the M&A IS challenges and their solutions. However, consolidation and integration across the research is limited. To redress this omission, we review 70 articles published between 1989 and 2016. To do this, we adopt and extend the methodology developed by Lacity and her colleagues to review the empirical evidence in a fragmented IT literature. We code 53 dependent variables and 195 independent variables to identify the robust relationships among them and to model how ISI decisions, including the choice of IS integration methods, partially mediate the effects of the independent variables on ISI outcomes. Examining the relationships in this model, we identify five quasi-independent thematic domains on which we draw to develop an agenda for future research. Our contribution is the aggregation, organization and structuring of the empirical findings in the M&A ISI literature as a basis on which to develop a cumulative knowledge process.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jitech/HenningssonYW18,cpid2:ffffffffffe00fffffffffffc10043ffc000001fc020001fc0013fffc0001fffc00001ffc3ffffffffffffffc24121ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00007ffc0000fffffffffffc7ffffffc0008003c0000003c0010003c0010047e0018003c0000003c0018003c0010003c0010003ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Asli",2014,MIS Quarterly,,38,1,1--28,10.25300/MISQ/2014/38.1.01,,,"A reliability generalization study (a meta-analysis of reliability coefficients) was conducted on three widely studied information systems constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM): perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intentions. This form of meta-analysis summarizes the reliability coefficients of the scores on a specified scale across studies and identifies the study characteristics that influence the reliability of these scores. Reliability is a critical issue in conducting empirical research as the reliability of the scores on well-established scales can vary with study characteristics, attenuating effect sizes. In conducting this study, an extensive literature search was conducted, with 380 articles reviewed and coded to perform reliability generalization. Study characteristics, including technology, sample, and measurement characteristics, for these articles were recorded along with effect size data for the relationships among these variables. After controlling for number of items, sample size, and sampling error, differences in reliability coefficients were found with several study characteristics for the three technology acceptance constructs. The reliability coefficients of PEOU and PU were lower in hedonic contexts than in utilitarian contexts, and were higher when the originally validated scales were used as compared to when other items were substituted. Only 27 percent of the studies that provided the measurement items used the original PEOU items, while 39 percent used the original PU items. Scales that were administered in English had higher reliability coefficients for PU and BI, with a marginal effect for PEOU. Reliability differences were also found for other study characteristics, including reliability type, subject experience, and gender composition.

Literature review on Group Support Systems (GSS) indicates that most prior GSS research focuses on supporting face-to-face teamwork, and few studies were conducted in supporting virtual teamwork and team-building. When virtual teamwork becomes more common in modern organizations, how GSS can be used to enhance virtual team-building is becoming an important research issue. This paper proposes a conceptual team-building framework. By embedding this conceptual framework into a GSS, the GSS may have the potential to support virtual team-building. Based on the framework, a set of testable research propositions is formulated, and some suggestions for future GSS research are discussed.",False,5,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,ng,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Virtual Teams

It has emerged with various applications of the Internet of Things, such as smart homes and smart factories. However, rapid technological development and careless use of the term mean that, in information systems (IS) research, a common understanding of smartness has not yet been established. While it is recognized that smartness encompasses more than the use of impressive information technology applications, a unified conceptualization of how smartness is manifested in IS research is lacking. To this end, we conducted a structured literature review applying techniques from Grounded Theory. We found that smartness occurs through actions, in which smart things and individuals interact, process information, and make data-based decisions that are perceived as smart. Building on these findings, we propose the concept of a 'smart action' and derive a general definition of smartness. Our findings augment knowledge about how smartness is formed, offering a new perspective on smartness. The concept of a smart action unifies and increases understanding of 'smartness' in IS research.

Building on two previous theoretical models, a systems success model relating six independent variables (external environment, organizational environment, user environment, IS operations environment, IS development environment, and information systems) to four success variables (use, satisfaction, individual impact, and organizational impact) was developed. This model was tested using data from 82 empirical studies in a meta-analysis. Results showed that all but one independent variable, external environment, had a significant relationship with success variables. In addition, each independent variable had varying strengths of relationships with different success variables. The findings yield important guidelines for the selection of variables in future research. The validated systems success model is general and theory based, and is useful in providing directions for future research.",True,23,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Testing,ng,,,meta-analysis,,False,none,False,,True,True,Other Domain

By using the findings from 69 studies, this research identified best (e.g. argument quality, valence, eWOM usefulness, trust in message), promising (e.g. eWOM credibility, emotional trust, attitude towards website) and least effective (e.g. volume, existing eWOM, source credibility) predictors of intention to buy in eWOM research. Additionally, the effect size of each predictor was calculated by performing meta-analysis. For academics, understanding what influences consumers’ intention to buy will help set the agenda for future research directions; for practitioners, it will provide benefit in terms of practical guidance based on detailed analysis of specific factors influencing consumers’ intention to buy, which could enhance their marketing activities.",,220,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/IsmagilovaSRD20,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,meta-analysis,,,,,,,,

Our review analyzes 48 empirical studies on individual and 51 studies on organizational IT adoption published between 1992 and 2003. In total, the sample contains 135 independent variables, eight dependent variables, and 505 relationships between independent and dependent variables. Furthermore, our sample includes both quantitative and qualitative studies. We were able to include qualitative studies because of a unique coding scheme, which can easily be replicated in other reviews. We use this sample to assess predictors, linkages, and biases in individual and organizational IT adoption research. The best predictors of individual IT adoption include Perceived Usefulness, Top Management Support, Computer Experience, Behavioral Intention, and User Support. The best predictors of IT adoption by organizations were Top Management Support, External Pressure, Professionalism of the IS Unit, and External Information Sources. At the level of independent variables, Top Management Support stands as the main linkage between individual and organizational IT adoption. But at an aggregate level, two collections of independent variables were good predictors of both individual and organizational IT adoption. These were innovation characteristics and organizational characteristics. Thus, we can consistently say that generic characteristics of the innovation and characteristics of the organization are strong predictors of IT adoption by both individuals and organizations. Based on an assessment of the predictors, linkages, and known biases, we prescribe 10 areas for further exploration.",True,698,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Testing,en,,,qualitative-systematic-review,,False,partial,True,,True,False,Other Domain

As marketers increasingly benefit from personalized advertising, the domain of privacy in personalized advertising (PPA) is gaining attention from researchers in both Marketing and Information Systems areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of extant literature, combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current state, primary themes, and future prospects of the PPA literature. Our research indicates that PPA research is in its early stages of development. While existing literature has predominantly examined privacy, personalization, trust, advertising, social media, and e-commerce, there has been a growing emphasis on targeted advertising and artificial intelligence in more recent studies. PPA is grounded in theoretical frameworks from privacy like Privacy Calculus Theory and from marketing such as the Persuasion Knowledge Model. Given that customer privacy concerns and trust in a firm can influence ad outcomes negatively, it is essential for researchers to explore scenarios where personalization might prove ineffective. In addition, examining firm strategies regarding personalized ads to mitigate negative ad outcomes is crucial.",,0,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the process perspective on alignment is a promising avenue to study the phenomenon's dynamic nature, we still know little about what it is that organizational actors actually do, on a day-to-day basis, to align IS and related concerns with business imperatives. In order to address this lack of understanding regarding the practices of aligning, we argue for research that goes beyond abstract macro analysis of alignment processes to that which considers the actual micro practices of aligning. An analysis of the extant literature on the topic leads to the identification and classification of aligning activities that are being undertaken in practice. We argue that this review and critical appraisal of the IT/business alignment field has the potential for substantive and insightful contributions to our understanding of alignment as it is enacted – in practice.

However, the pervasive adoption of AI has raised significant concerns regarding the privacy of employees. This systematic literature review seeks to comprehensively explore the implications of AI on employee privacy. The study addresses three key dimensions: (1) evaluating the extent to which AI technologies compromise or safeguard employee privacy; (2) elucidating the costs and benefits of AI adoption in organizations to strike a balance with employee privacy considerations; and (3) discussing the varying impact of advancing AI algorithms in the workplace on employee privacy. Drawing upon the privacy calculus framework, the paper underscores the trade-offs organizations make in managing employees' privacy in the context of AI integration. The discussion is grounded in an analysis of advancing AI algorithms and their dynamic influence on the delicate balance between organizational efficiency and the protection of employee privacy. By addressing the complexities inherent in this intersection, the research serves as a valuable resource for guiding further inquiry into the evolving relationship between advancing AI technologies and preserving employee privacy.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper identifies and discusses the persistent problems and development practices of information systems development (ISD). A critical examination and comparison of past times’‘traditional’ and present‐day ‘web‐based’ development shows that contemporary ISD can be seen as an accentuated evolution – rather than a revolution – of well‐known challenges and solutions. On this basis, (1) diversity; (2) knowledge; and (3) structure are identified as inherent and interrelated problems, while the practices for coping with these three challenges are (a) organization and specialization; (b) constant verbal communication and negotiation; and (c) pragmatic application of certain development methods and methodical concepts. We conclude that more research on the occurrence and interaction of problems and practices at, and between, different contextual levels (e.g. the business environment, company, project, team and individual levels) is needed to understand and assess (the gap between) ‘observed practice’ and ‘good practice’ across the many types of Web and non‐Web ISD projects conducted today.

The extant literature cites inadequate sample size, lack of process orientation, and analysis methods among the reasons some studies have shown mixed results in establishing a relationship between IT investment and firm performance. In this paper we examine the structural variables that affect IT payoff through a meta analysis of 66 firm-level empirical studies between 1990 and 2000. Employing logistic regression and discriminant analyses, we present statistical evidence of the characteristics that discriminate between IT payoff studies that observed a positive effect and those that did not. In addition, we conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on a continuous measure of IT payoff to examine the influence of structural variables on the result of IT payoff studies. The results indicate that the sample size, data source (firm-level or secondary), and industry in which the study is conducted influence the likelihood of the study finding greater improvements on firm performance. The choice of the dependent variable(s) also appears to influence the outcome (although we did not find support for process-oriented measurement), the type of statistical analysis conducted, and whether the study adopted a cross-sectional or longitudinal design. Finally, we present implications of the findings and recommendations for future research.",True,347,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Testing,en,,,meta-analysis,,False,none,False,,True,False,IS Value

In this context, a relational perspective grounded in sociomateriality has gained prominence. This perspective views agency as emerging from the interactions among humans and technological systems. Despite its existence within the IS community, the relational paradigm remains underrepresented in discussions of AI agency due to its ontological complexities. Recognizing that it offers potential solutions to conceptual challenges faced by alternative perspectives, the article aims to enhance the accessibility and applicability of the relational perspective for AI research. We provide a structured overview and comparative analysis of agency concepts in IS research, derived from a systematic literature review of 295 journal articles from IS and adjacent disciplines. Besides relational agency, the review identifies two other main conceptualizations of agency: inherent agency and behavioral agency. To explain their differences, we contrast the relational perspective with the alternative frameworks, detailing their respective strength and limitations. Finally, we communicate open questions and research directions to promote the practical application of a relational perspective in studying AI technologies.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our review finds that, In practice, the academic literature on IT outsourcing has very much honored both rigor and relevance In the ways In which research has been conducted. Our central purpose In the review was to answer two research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about information technology outsourcing (ITO) decisions and outcomes? What are the gaps In knowledge to consider In future ITO research? To answer these questions, we examined 164 empirical ITO articles published between 1992 and 2010 In 50 journals. Adapting a method used by Jeyaraj et al. (2006), we encapsulated this vast empirical literature on ITO In a way that was concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 36 dependent variables, 138 independent variables, and 741 relationships between Independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of outsourcing: one model addressed ITO decisions and one model addressed ITO outcomes. The model of ITO decisions includes Independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, client firm characteristics, and influence sources. The model of ITO outcomes includes Independent variables associated with client and supplier capabilities, relationship characteristics, contractual governance, decision characteristics, and transaction attributes. We also examined the interactions among broad categories of variables and the learning curve effects resulting from feedback loops. Overall, ITO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of ITO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done. We reviewed recent studies that have identified gaps in current knowledge and proposed future paths of research pertaining to strategic motivations, environmental influences, dynamic interactions, configurational and portfolio approaches, global destinations, emerging models, reference theory extension, and grounded theory development.",True,281,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Testing,en,,,qualitative-systematic-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,True,Outsourcing

Worldwide, the current BPO market could be as much as $279 billion and is predicted to continue growing at 25% annually. Academic researchers have been studying this market for about 15 years and have produced findings relevant to practice. The entire body of BPO research has never been reviewed, and this paper fills that gap. We filtered the total studies and reviewed 87 empirically robust BPO articles published between 1996 and 2011 in 67 journals to answer three research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about BPO decisions and outcomes? How do BPO findings compare with Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) empirical research? What are the gaps in knowledge to consider in future BPO research? Employing a proven method that Lacity et al. (2010) used to review the empirical ITO literature, we encapsulated this empirical literature on BPO in a way that is concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 43 dependent variables, 152 independent variables, and 615 relationships between independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of BPO: one model addresses BPO decisions and one model addresses BPO outcomes. The model of BPO decisions includes independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, and client firm characteristics. The model of BPO outcomes includes independent variables associated with contractual and relational governance, country characteristics, and client and supplier capabilities. Overall, BPO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of BPO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done.

In this paper, we review and analyze two literatures on the construct of human trust in IT artifacts and in the entities that source, operate, and govern IT. The first literature review focuses on defining of the construct of trust across a range of disciplines. Our analysis of this literature identified 13 assumptions about the nature of trust. The assumptions illustrate the complexities of human trust. The second literature review focused on 214 empirical studies of the construct of trust published in the AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Eight journals. We analyze this literature to identify IS scholar’s most common assessments of trust from qualitative studies and most common measures of trust from quantitative studies. As a cumulative body of knowledge, IS scholars have deeply examined the multidimensional aspect of trust by examining different types of trust, including affective trust, cognitive trust, institutional trust, instrumental trust, intrinsic trust, knowledge-based trust, relational trust, swift trust, disposition to trust, trusting beliefs, and more. IS scholars have also extensively examined the assumption that trust is dynamic, as evidenced by the many qualitative papers that examined trust as a process. Our review also finds that IS scholars have conducted extensive research examining trust in Web2 technologies, which are characterized by centralized applications and centralized governance. While the IS scholarly community has established a substantial tradition around the construct of trust, there is still interesting work to be done. With recent releases of open generative AI and with the rise of Web3 technologies like blockchains that purport to be “trustless,” the construct of trust in IT needs to be re-examined in these emerging contexts. We also encourage more research on trust in bi-directional relationships, on the limits of transitive trust, and on the construct of distrust.",,18,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02683962231226397,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

In regard to the emerging literature on GenAI, we explore 1) how established AI ethics principles are presented and 2) what new ethical principles have surfaced. The results indicate that established ethical principles continue to be relevant for GenAI systems but their salience and interpretation may shift, and that there is a need to recognize new principles in these systems. We identify six GenAI ethics principles: 1) respect for intellectual property, 2) truthfulness, 3) robustness, 4) recognition of malicious uses, 5) sociocultural responsibility, and 6) human-centric design. Addressing the challenge of satisfying multiple principles simultaneously, we suggest three meta-principles: categorizing and ranking principles to distinguish fundamental from supporting ones, mapping contradictions between principle pairs to understand their nature, and implementing continuous monitoring of fundamental principles due to the evolving nature of GenAI systems and their applications. To conclude, we suggest increased research emphasis on complementary ethics approaches to principlism, ethical tensions between different ethical viewpoints, end-user perspectives on the explainability and understanding of GenAI, and the salience of ethics principles to various GenAI stakeholders.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the corpus of 121 articles, we find that the effective use of AI-supported AgriDSS is hindered at technical, social, ethical, and ecological levels. Then, drawing on the experiential learning perspective, we propose how conjoint experiential learning (CEL) can enhance sustainable agricultural practices by enhancing both AI and human learning and overcoming roadblocks in using AgriDSS.

This study systematically reviews papers on IT in China published in the ‘Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals’ from 2000 to 2013. We have two specific objectives: to identify key research issues and trends, and to propose future directions for research on IT in China. This paper categorizes the global distribution of authors and their research methods. Five research streams are identified, including human behaviors in IS adoption and use, IS management, e-Business, social media, digital collaborations and group support, and industry and societal issues in IS. While each stream is examined in detail, we specifically pay attention to the effect of the Chinese context in each paper and the approaches to contextualizing the research.

While this research has been prescriptive of contract terms that lead to successful outsourcing, there is need for clarity on what specific governance options are available at each moment of governance and how governance choices at one moment affect those at another, and consequently affect outsourcing outcomes. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical work in the areas of governance and contracts to develop a model of IS outsourcing governance, delineating specific moments of governance (MoG). It describes how the IS outsourcing context circumscribes market, hierarchy, and network governance options that are available at the promissory contract and psychological contract moments. Processes and structures that constitute governance choices at each moment of governance are identified. This analysis of outcomes recognizes an inherent tension in interorganizational relationships: firms’ desire for value capture or efficiency vs their desire for value creation or innovation. We explore how choices in formulating the promissory contract affect the psychological contract, and how psychological contract choices impact value capture and creation. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of the MoG model for practitioners and suggesting areas in which further conceptualization and empirical work may be beneficial.",False,80,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Outsourcing

The analysis revealed that most research has been done in formulating challenges and barriers, implementation plan, evaluation/assessment and success factors of e-government while studies on knowledge management in e-government, readiness for e-government, e-Gov. process and security/privacy issues could get only limited attention.

To reconcile these inconsistent findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationships among PMT constructs while also considering additional contextual constructs that are not specified in PMT. Ninety-two published studies were meta-analyzed and estimated using structural equation modeling. Our results provide support for three of the five predictors of security motivation intention, as postulated by PMT, mixed support for perceived vulnerability, and no support for response cost. We found that coping appraisal variables of response efficacy and self-efficacy have the largest average effects on security behavior. In addition, cultural attributes of collectivism and individualism moderated some of the pairwise correlations, PMT-theoretic relationships were generally stronger in personal contexts than in workplace contexts, and the intention-behavior relationship was strongest in workplace and compliance settings. Our results contribute to the information security literature by providing guidance for future PMT-related research and by demonstrating how meta-analysis and structural equation modeling can be combined to test theories in information systems research.",,50,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/MouCBK22,cpid2:fffffffffdfffffff87ffc0ff8400007fdc0000ffffffffffffffffff000000ff100000fffffffffff8011ffff8001ffffc003fffffefffff800001ff800003ffc00001ffc00003ffc00003ffc00003ffc00001ffc0001fff800003ff000094ff87f902ff079800ff001800ff001800ff001800fffff914fffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/MouCBK22,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the current political economy, we argue that the multiple meanings of “value” cannot be reduced to a single domain or discipline, but rather they are invariably articulated at the juxtaposition of three domains: social, economic, and technical. We analyse each of these domains and present domain challenges and cross-domain implications – drawing from an interdisciplinary literature review and gap analysis across sources from academia, business, and governments. We propose a functional model that aggregates these findings into a value-driven logic of the emerging global political economy enabled by digital technology in general and IoT in particular.

They unify and integrate several technological approaches, including big data analysis and artificial intelligence, enhancing real-time monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. An extensive knowledge base formed by various disciplines, including information systems, engineering, and computer science, already exists for CPS. However, this knowledge has not been holistically captured and structured to date. To address this research gap, this study conducts a large-scale literature review of 2365 papers representing the current state of the research and then develops a novel categorization on industrial CPS with 10 sections, 32 areas, and 246 fields. The categorization is presented in hierarchical graphical form and can also be utilized as a web tool. To conclude, a perspective on future research needs and potentials to enhance Industry 4.0 in both research and practice are offered.",,63,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of maturity models is to evaluate and improve the organization’s practices by creating an improvement roadmap. However, the utilization of the methodologies and methods by this community for the development of this kind of tools is not consensual. Several investigators have created guidelines for the development of maturity models, but the authors are not adopting them; they prefer to adopt their own methodologies. In this research, with the objective of reviewing the methodologies, methods, and guidelines used by the scientific community to develop IT maturity models, a Systematic Literature Review and a Critical analysis were made in order to realize a comparison between IT maturity models and Non-IT maturity models.

The purpose of this paper is to suggest a dynamic capability in a cybersecurity intelligence (DCCI) model based on existing literature that helped firms reduce risks of cyber violations and advance the development of systems and the life cycle of firms. Through a meta-synthesis, an abduction and induction approach through eight methodological steps analyzed in forty-seven case studies the presence of cybersecurity capabilities to build CI. Combining theoretical and practical information security maturity models as a foundation, we understand capabilities building to improve the predictability of cyber incidents. The results evidenced four second-order dimensions to build CI named doing, enabling, improving, and managing cybersecurity, and eight first-order outcomes to represent the DCCI model. This research makes an unprecedented contribution to international and national scenarios, as it will allow firms to innovate their resource management processes and abilities to enable better cybersecurity projects and reduce the impacts of potential cyberattacks with the probability of eradicating vulnerabilities.",,6,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/PigolaC23,,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/cais/PigolaC23,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a systematic review of 135 studies examining RAT's application to phishing. Our findings indicate that although RAT is widely prevalent in the literature, it often neglects critical aspects such as detailed victim profiles and underlying factors influencing susceptibility to phishing attacks. To address this gap, we developed a new cybercriminological theory that specifically aims to explain phishing victimization. The proposed Experience-Consequence Theory of Phishing Susceptibility focuses on the understanding of the consequences of clicking on suspicious links and the victims’ prior experiences with phishing. These elements can help security professionals identify better strategies for reducing phishing victimization by tailoring security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs to meet the specific needs of their employees. Furthermore, this theory has managerial implications because it offers organizations a more comprehensive and robust approach to reducing the risk of social engineering and improving the overall security posture.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within organizations, IS habits may develop over long periods of time and are typically embedded within larger, frequently practiced, higher-level work routines or task sequences. When new systems are introduced for the purpose of at least partially replacing incumbent systems, existing IS habits embedded in these routines may inhibit adoption and use of the new systems. Therefore, understanding how work-related IS habits form, how they enable and inhibit behavior, and how they can be disrupted or encouraged requires that we examine them within the context of organizational and individual level work routines. The current study integrates psychology and organizational behavior literature on cognitive scripts and work routines to examine IS habits as they occur embedded within larger, more complex task sequences. The objective of the paper is to contribute to the IS habit literature by (1) situating IS habits within the context of their associated work routines and task sequences, and (2) providing a theoretical understanding of how incumbent system habits can be disrupted, and how development of new system habits can be encouraged, within this context. We draw from extant research in psychology, organizational behavior, and consumer behavior to offer propositions about context-focused organizational interventions to break, or otherwise discourage, the continued performance of incumbent system habits and to encourage the development of new system habits. Specifically, our theoretical development includes script disruption techniques, training-in-context, and performance goal suspension as organizational interventions that disrupt incumbent system habits. We further theorize how stabilizing contextual variables associated with modified work routines can facilitate the development of new system habits. The paper concludes by discussing the importance of combining intervention strategies to successfully disrupt incumbent system habits and encourage development of new system habits and thus facilitate adoption of new systems.",False,119,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://misq.umn.edu/misq/article-pdf/37/1/221/5547/10_politeskarahanna.pdf,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Human Computer Interaction

However, there is considerable divergence in conducting such studies and reporting their findings. Therefore, we aim (1) to evaluate how mixed-methods studies have developed in information systems research under the existence of heavily used guidelines and (2) to reflect on those observations in terms of potential for future research. During our review, we identified 52 mixed-methods papers and quantitatively elaborated on the adherence to the three core concepts of mixed-methods in terms of purpose, meta-inferences, and validation. Findings discover that only eight adhere to all three of them. We discuss the significance of our results for current and upcoming mixed-methods research and derive specific suggestions for authors. With our study, we contribute to mixed-methods research by showing how to leverage the insights from existing guidelines to strengthen future research and by contributing to the discussion of the legislation associated with research guidelines, in general, presenting the status quo in current literature.",,,,cpid2:fffffffffc003ffffc00003ffc60003ff008010fffffffffe000003fe000007ff07ffffffffc3fffff581dfffe0ff07ffffefffff000000fe0000007e0000007e0000007e000000ff000dddfe000000ff03ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffbdf7effffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct human interaction with ICT, as well as perceptions, emotions, and thoughts regarding the implementation of ICT in organizations and its pervasiveness in society in general, may lead to notable stress perceptions--a type of stress referred to as technostress. Analysis of the information systems (IS) literature reveals that technostress has hardly been addressed from a biological perspective. This is problematic, because biology not only provides objective measurements, but also, to a notable degree, determines human behavior toward ICT. Most important, biological measures (e.g., stress hormone levels, cardiovascular activity) are crucial predictors of human health, making them an indispensable complement to self-reports on stress perceptions. Against this background, the present article reviews the technostress research based on biological approaches that has been published in various disciplines such as human-computer interaction, medicine, biological psychology, and ergonomics. With the goal of developing a ""big-picture"" view of technostress and biology, this article integrates a body of highly fragmented work. The review reveals significant negative biological effects that develop from human interaction with ICT (e.g., increased activity of the cardiovascular system, or elevated levels of stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol). However, the review also indicates that countermeasures, which may positively affect biological parameters (e.g., reduced levels of stress hormones), do exist. Drawing on the literature review, this article also specifies a research agenda for future technostress research. The agenda is organized along three themes (theory and methods, design science and engineering, health and coping strategies), and proposes fifteen research questions (topics) that can be addressed in future investigations.",False,203,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,scoping-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Human Computer Interaction

Studies suggest that top management support is an important driver of IT assimilation; however, this broad takeaway provides little substantive guidance to researchers and practitioners. We also have a limited understanding of whether and when IT assimilation creates business value. We take stock of this literature with a meta-analysis. We found that top management support is positively related to IT assimilation, and assimilation is in turn positively related to the business value of IT. We also found that explicit support does not have any special effect on IT assimilation (compared to implicit support) and may not be related to business value at all. However, our results indicate that IT assimilation has a stronger effect on business value at the process level (versus firm level) and for enterprise IT innovations (versus function IT innovations). Finally, we found that support-assimilation and assimilation-value relationships are stronger in high (versus low) power distance cultures. Our collective findings can facilitate future research and help practitioners navigate IT assimilation initiatives.",,6,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/RobertsJP22,,rev_synthesized,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jais/RobertsJP22,,,eng,,,meta-analysis,,,,,,,,

As these systems may execute a task without the permission of a human agent, they raise major safety and responsibility issues. To identify the relevant issues for information systems, we conducted a critical and scoping review of the literature from many disciplines. The innovative methodology we used combines bibliometrics techniques, grounded theory and a critical conceptual framework to analyse the structure and research themes of the field. Our findings show that there are certain ironies in the way in which responsibility for apparently safe autonomous systems is apportioned. These ironies are interconnected and reveal that there remains significant uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. The ironies draw attention to the challenges of safety and responsibility with ADS and possibly other cyber-physical systems in our increasingly digital world. We make seven recommendations related to (1) value sensitive design and system theory approaches; (2) stakeholders’ interests and interactions; (3) task allocation; (4) deskilling; (5) controllability; (6) responsibility (moral and legal); (7) trust. We suggest five areas for future IS research on ADS. These areas are related to socio-technical systems, critical research, safety, responsibility and trust.",,10,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02683962231207108,,eng,,,scoping-review,,,,,,,,

CBDCs combine new technology-enabled infrastructure and service innovation from the realm of FinTech and Decentralized Finance with the well-established and highly regulated area of central banking. While current practice and research primarily focus on designing specific CBDC systems or the governmental role, the role of companies and the private sector in the CBDC ecosystem still needs to be explored. Addressing this gap is particularly pertinent given the uncertainty surrounding which value propositions from traditional financial ecosystems and those from Fintech and blockchain-based financial ecosystems might be transferable to the realm of CBDCs. In this regard, the potential emergence of entirely novel value propositions companies could offer uniquely to CBDCs adds another layer of complexity. This paper aims to fill this gap by shedding light on private organizations’ value propositions in CBDC ecosystems. Through a multivocal literature review, we comprehensively gather both academic and practitioner insights. We aggregate value propositions directly stated in the current literature base and verify and complement these findings by mapping the needs of a CBDC ecosystem to value propositions companies might offer to fulfill these needs.",,0,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ITO researchers have established an extensive knowledge base on the determinant factors that drive sourcing decisions from various theoretical perspectives, the majority of research on cloud-sourcing decisions focuses on technological aspects. We reviewed the CC and ITO literature and systematically coded the determinant factors that influence sourcing decisions. We show that most determinant factors of sourcing decisions in the ITO context remain valid for the CC context. However, the findings for some factors (i.e., asset specificity, client firm IT capabilities, client firm size, institutional influences, and uncertainty) are inconclusive for the CC and ITO contexts. We discuss how the peculiarities of CC can explain these inconclusive findings. Our results indicate that CC researchers should draw from research on ITO decision making but re-examine ITO concepts in the light of the peculiarities of CC, such as the differences between software and infrastructure services, the self-service procurement of cloud services, or the evolving role of IT departments. By summarizing determinant factors of cloud-sourcing decisions for consideration in future research, we contribute to the development of endogenous theories in the IS domain.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jitech/SchneiderS16,cpid2:ffffffffffe01ffbffffffffc000003fc000000fc0000007c000001fc01fffffc4ffffffc001ffffc0ffffffffffffffcfffffffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00000ffcbffffffc7ffffffc001817fc0008003c0010003c0010003c0000003c0010003c0008003ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide scholars with an overview of the literature, we performed a systematic qualitative review of the IS literature. The goal of our review was to identify the antecedents and consequences of trust in technology that have received frequent empirical support, as well as those for which the evidence is not yet conclusive. To that end, we curated a glossary of unique construct terms and summarized the results of 241 relationships tested in 62 empirical research articles (both quantitative and qualitative) from the AIS “Basket of Eight” journals. From these, we identified 62 unique relationships: 22 are well-supported, 6 are supported by suggestive evidence, and 34 have received little support. These relationships summarize what is well-known and less well-known within the literature. By taking stock, we prepare a path for future research on the phenomenon of trust in the context of emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and blockchain). We conclude the paper with opportunities and directions for future research.",,9,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/02683962241254392,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper synthesizes past research on the topic and proposes a unified model on ISD success through a systematic and comprehensive literature review. The unified model highlights that ISD is a complex and interactive process involving individual, team, and organization factors, as well as ISD methodology.

Manipulations contribute to mispricing, market imperfections and an increase in transaction costs for market participants and in costs of capital for issuers. Manipulations are facilitated by increased transaction velocity, speculative trading and abusive usage of new trading technologies, i.e., they are directly linked to financial sector changes that drive financialization. Research at the intersection of financialization and IS might support regulatory authorities and market operators in improving market surveillance and helping to detect fraudulent activities. However, confusing terminology is prevalent on financial markets with respect to different manipulation techniques and their characteristics, which hampers efficient fraud detection. Furthermore, recognizing manipulations is challenging given the large number of information sources and the vast number of trades occurring not least because of high-frequency traders. Therefore, automated market surveillance tools require a comprehensive taxonomy of financial market manipulations as a basis for appropriate configuration. Based on a cluster analysis of SEC litigation releases, a review of the latest market abuse regulation and academic studies, we develop a taxonomy of manipulations that structures and details existing manipulation techniques and reveals how these techniques differ along several dimensions. In a case study, we show how the taxonomy can be utilized to guide the development of appropriate decision support systems for fraud detection.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jitech/SieringCEG17,cpid2:ffffffffffe006ffffffffffc02003ffc00001ffc00001ffc000001fc000007fc0ffffffc04887ffc000c7ffc090ffffc07fffffe07fffffcfffffffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc0001fffc3fffbffffffffffc7ffffffc0000003c0008003ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Several approaches for and against the unauthorized copying of software have been proposed. These approaches can be divided into two categories: moral reasoning and solution. These categories of approaches to unauthorized copying of software are scrutinized in the light of Kohlberg's theory of Cognitive Moral Development. The results suggest that most approaches presenting solutions to unauthorized copying of software have focused attention on the lower levels of moral development, while approaches at the highest stage are few and far between. No single approach covers all the stages of moral development. The implications of this analysis for practice and research are discussed.",False,29,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Describing,en,,,narrative-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Other Domain

Research contributions in relation to these four security issues are analyzed from three viewpoints: a meta-model for information systems, the research approaches used, and the reference disciplines used. Our survey reveals that most information security research has focused on the technical context, and on issues of access to IS and secure communication. The corresponding security issues have been resolved by using mathematical approaches as a research approach. The reference disciplines most commonly reflected have been mathematics, including philosophical logic. Based on this analysis, we suggest new directions for studying information security from an information systems viewpoint, with respect to research methodology and research questions. Empirical studies in relation to the issues of security management and the development of secure IS, based on suitable reference theories (e.g., psychology, sociology, semiotics, and philosophy), are particularly necessary.",False,129,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Describing,en,,,narrative-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Security

However, qualitative methods that require manually perusing each document struggle with the width and breadth of such data. Although quantitative and qualitative big data share many challenges, we identified the practical challenges encountered by researchers, specifically with qualitative big data, and how these challenges were addressed. We reviewed 169 studies that used qualitative big data and identified three main categories of intertwined challenges: locating relevant data, addressing noise in the data, and preserving data richness. We found that the greater the amount of data and the richer they are, the greater the variety of types and sources of noise. While the volume of the data necessitates the use of algorithms, doing so entails the treatment of data in ways that decrease the richness of qualitative data. Furthermore, simultaneously ensuring high richness and veracity might be difficult because the algorithms are probabilistic, thus compelling researchers to balance the desired levels of volume, variety, and veracity. Although the identified solutions cannot completely solve this tripartite balancing, they can still be used to alleviate different aspects of such a challenge.",,1,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

The meta-analysis results spanning across 60 studies with more than 122,000 cumulative observations found BI➔UB as the strongest path with all significant values. PE➔BI emerged as the most utilized path with most significant values underscoring the emphasis placed by consumers on utilitarian value. Meanwhile, with most non-significant path values the future usage of EE➔BI path is been cautioned and questioned. Finally, trust, personal innovativeness, perceived risk, attitude, and self-efficacy were found as the five topmost UTAUT2 extensions.",,192,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/isf/TamilmaniRD21,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper also suggests that anthropology constitutes a promising reference discipline for cultural IS research. In line with recent research in IS and anthropology, future IS research may consider defining culture consistently as shared values among the members of a collective rather than as a nation state since the former definition accounts for the fact that nation states are no longer culturally homogeneous.",False,11,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,critical-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Other Domain

However, the extant literature on health AI reveals significant issues regarding each of the areas of responsible AI, posing moral and ethical consequences. This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens. A systematic literature review supported our data collection and sampling procedure, the corresponding analysis, and extraction of research themes helped us provide an evidence-based foundation. We contribute with a systematic description and explanation of the intellectual structure of Responsible AI in digital health and develop an agenda for future research.",,121,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a comprehensive review of this literature and identified a rich set of voluntariness concepts and methods of operationalization. However, while considerable empirical evidence is reported in the literature, our review also revealed inconsistent results concerning the relationship between voluntariness and other concepts. Against that backdrop, we synthesized the literature into three types of voluntariness - perceived, intended and realizable voluntariness (RVOL), and showed how prior literature had not adequately accounted for RVOL. Moreover, we examined the multiple mechanisms that influence voluntariness and created a model to describe how to advance new knowledge about the important relationships among the three types of voluntariness and between voluntariness and user behavior. We argue that these concepts and relationships may help advance our knowledge of how a new technology is used individually and collectively in organizations.",,,https://dblp.org/rec/journals/jitech/TsaiCM17,cpid2:ffffffffffe01ffbffffffffc0901013c0000017c000003fc000ffffc0001fffc0601fffe00007ffcfffffffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc00001ffc7ffffffffffffffc7ffffffc0018003c0010003c0018003c0008003c0010003c0010007c0008003c0008003c0010003ffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

However, achieving mature alignment between business and IT is difficult due to the rapid changes in the business and IT environments. This article provides a systematic review of studies on the alignment of business and IT. The research articles reviewed are based on topics of alignment, the definition of alignment, history, alignment challenges, phases of alignment, alignment measurement approaches, the importance of alignment in business industries, how software engineering helps in better alignment, and the role of the business environment in aligning business with IT. It aims to present a thorough understanding of business-IT alignment and to provide a list of future research directions regarding alignment.

While many laboratory experiments have been conducted to examine the effect of sunk costs on escalation, there has been no effort to examine these studies as a group in order to determine the effect size associated with the so-called “sunk cost effect.” Using meta-analysis, we analyzed the results of 20 sunk cost experiments and found: (1) a large effect size associated with sunk costs, and (2) stronger effects in experiments involving information technology (IT) projects as opposed to non-IT projects.

Within this field of study, informal social networks are rapidly gaining attention as mechanisms that facilitate knowledge flows. Electronic networks of practice (NoPs) are a special case of informal network where the sharing of practice-related knowledge occurs primarily through computer-based communication technologies. However, we know relatively little about the dynamics of knowledge exchange that occur in these electronic networks. This conceptual paper posits that there is a relationship between the structural properties of electronic NoPs and successful knowledge exchange. The theoretical positions of social network theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm are used to support this claim. A review of the extant literature reveals that a clear conceptual framework for NoPs is lacking. The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of such a framework by addressing a largely neglected area within the growing network of practice literature – namely, the relationship between electronic network communication structure and knowledge flows.",False,37,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Knowledge Management

Trying to exploit the strategic business potential embedded in big data, many organizations have started to renovate their business models or develop new ones, giving rise to the phenomenon of big-data business models. Although big-data business model research is still in its infancy, a significant number of studies on the topic have been published since 2014. We thus suggest it is time to perform a critical review and assessment of the literature at the intersection of business models and big data (analytics), thereby responding to recent calls for further research on and sustained analysis of big-data business models. In particular, our review uses three major criteria (big-data business model types, dimensions, and deployment) to assess the state of the big-data business model literature and identify shortcomings in this literature. On this basis, we derive and discuss five central research perspectives (supply chain, stakeholder, ethics, national, and process), providing guidance for future research and theory development in the area. These perspectives also have practical implications on how to address the current big-data business model deployment gap.",,120,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with constructivist frameworks and ethnographic approaches it has allowed the development of rich local pictures of the immediate and adaptive response by user organizations to the take-up of what are, today, often generic packaged systems. However, to view the packaged enterprise solution principally at the place where the user encounters it also has limitations. It produces somewhat partial understandings of these complex artifacts. In particular, it downplays important influences from other sites and time frames. This paper argues that if we are to understand the full implications of enterprise solutions for organizations then we should study their “biography.” This idea points to how the career of workplace technology is often played out over multiple time frames and settings. To understand its shaping therefore requires scholars to go beyond the study of technology at a single locale or moment and, rather, attempt to follow it through space and time. The paper develops two ideas to aid this kind of study. We discuss better spatial metaphors that might help us explore the hybrid and extended spaces in which packaged software systems develop and evolve. We also review improved temporal understandings that may capture the multiple contemporary and historical time frames at play. The paper concludes by discussing some possible research directions that a focus on the biography of a technology might allow.",False,66,,,rev_synthesized,,,,Understanding,en,,,scoping-review,,True,comprehensive,True,,True,False,Other Domain

It is now well-acknowledged that emerging economies are beginning to innovate at a rapid rate despite some of the challenges they face. Given that these countries with such economies now comprise a third of the world's largest 25 economies, and that they are likely to be critical for the success of a global economy, it is important to understand how these economies innovate, what factors affect innovation in such nations, and what are the impacts. However, to the best of our knowledge, little research till date has been conducted on this topic, and the few existing studies have failed to catch the attention of the mainstream IS research community. We believe that the absence of studies is primarily due to a lack of understanding of what has been found with respect to ICT innovation in emerging economies, what needs to be studied, and how they should be studied. We attempt to contribute in this area by: (1) providing a comprehensive framework of existing research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, (2) highlighting the gaps that have been left behind, and (3) providing specific guidelines to future researchers, including a research model summarizing the salient issues that need examination.

Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model as an overarching theoretical basis, our meta-analysis examines the aggregated effects of widely investigated antecedents (as central and peripheral cues) and moderating roles of research contexts (referring to the elaboration likelihood). It reveals a stronger link with soft information–related factors, weaker ties with backer-related factors, and varied effects of project factors. Crowdfunding success measure, crowdfunding model, platform popularity, and project location are important reasons for the inconsistencies in findings across individual studies. Our research offers valuable insights for stakeholders in the crowdfunding ecosystem. For backers, it empowers them to select projects with greater potential for success among the vast number of available options, ensuring more informed investment decisions. Fundraisers can leverage our findings to refine their fundraising strategies, thereby boosting their chances of securing funds effectively. Crowdfunding platforms can harness our findings to refine their system architecture, enrich service offerings, and improve user satisfaction.

Owning to the rapid spread of wearable and mobile devices, this technique is evolving healthcare from traditional hub-based systems to more personalised healthcare systems. This trend is well-aligned with recent “Healthcare 4.0” which is a continuous process of transforming the entire healthcare value chain to be preventive, precise, predictive and personalised, with significant benefits to elder care. But empowering the utility of multimodal wearable intelligence technique for elderly care like people with dementia is significantly challenging considering many issues, such as shortage of cost-effective wearable sensors, heterogeneity of wearable devices connected, high demand for interoperability, etc. Focusing on these challenges, this paper gives a systematic review of advanced multimodal wearable intelligence technologies for dementia care in Healthcare 4.0. One framework is proposed for reviewing the current research of wearable intelligence, and key enabling technologies, major applications, and successful case studies in dementia care, and finally points out future research trends and challenges in Healthcare 4.0.",,,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, it remains a challenge for organizations to retain top IT talent as the business context and the nature of work change. Retention strategies that have worked with other business professionals have faced limited success with IT talent, leading some scholars to ask whether the latter are unique in terms of culture, personality, and tools. This study seeks to address this question by (1) undertaking a meta-analysis of studies investigating the turnover intentions of IT professionals, and by (2) conducting a second-order meta-analysis to compare findings between IT and non-IT professionals. The meta-analytic findings identify new antecedents more recently examined in information systems (IS) research while confirming enduring relationships between antecedents and turnover intention. The second-order meta-analysis provides intriguing findings regarding the potential uniqueness of IT professionals. We provide an integrative discussion on the state of turnover intention research within the IS discipline, start a dialog on interdisciplinary comparisons, and offer a forward-looking agenda for future research. We conclude by calling on scholars to revitalize turnover intention research within the IS field by moving toward fresh theories, fresh constructs, and fresh approaches.",,12,,cpid2:fffffffffc7fffffe007ffffe0020003e0f20007fffffffff000000fe0000007ffc007fffffe7fffffc003ffff8003ffffd00fffff0000fff9fffebff800001ff800001ff800001ff800001ff800001ff800003ff8101fffff97ffffe0008007e0498007e0018007e0018007ffffffffe13ff5ffffffffffffffffffffffffff,rev_synthesized,,,,,eng,,,meta-analysis,,,,,,,,

We explore this issue by comprehensively examining the literature on cultural effects on collaborative software use. This article makes several contributions by providing common nomenclatures and theoretical perspectives that are essential to promoting scientific progress in this area. It focuses mainly on empirical collaborative software studies in which culture is a key conceptual construct. We discuss underlying cultural theories, research methodologies, and findings of major collaborative software studies on the impact of culture.

In the information and communication technology (ICT) context, a growing number of studies consider the affective dimension of human interaction with ICTs. However, few of these studies take systematic approaches, resulting in inconsistent conclusions and contradictory advice for researchers and practitioners. Many of these issues stem from ambiguous conceptualizations of various affective concepts and their relationships. Before researchers can address questions such as “what causes affective responses in an ICT context” and “what impacts do affective responses have on human interaction with ICTs,” a theoretical foundation for affective concepts and their relationships has to be established. This theory and review paper addresses three research questions: (1) What are pertinent affective concepts in the ICT context? (2) In what ways are these affective concepts similar to, or different from each other? (3) How do these affective concepts relate to or influence one another? Based on theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, the affective response model (ARM) is developed. ARM is a theoretically bound conceptual framework that provides a systematic and holistic reference map for any ICT study that considers affect. It includes a taxonomy that classifies affective concepts along five dimensions: the residing, the temporal, the particular/general stimulus, the object/behavior stimulus, and the process/outcome dimensions. ARM also provides a nomological network to indicate the causal or co-occurring relationships among the various types of affective concepts in an ICT interaction episode. ARM has the power for explaining and predicting, as well as prescribing, potential future research directions.",False,228,,,rev_synthesized,,,https://misq.umn.edu/misq/article-pdf/37/1/247/5543/11_pingzhang.pdf,Explaining,en,,,theoretical-review,,False,partial,True,,True,True,Human Computer Interaction

These concerns can impede the adoption and operational success of SHMSs, leading to dissatisfaction among both consumers and service providers. Despite the significance of privacy, existing literature on SHMSs tends to offer a somewhat fragmented exploration of this concept due to the complex nature of surveillance and the involvement of multiple stakeholders. To address this gap, this study develops a contextual framework based on a systematic review of 49 peer-reviewed articles, offering valuable insights for scholars seeking to understand the multifaceted privacy concerns in SHMS contexts. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating theoretical perspectives that better capture the intricate dynamics of smart health environments, helping healthcare providers and policymakers identify and address potential privacy issues when developing and implementing surveillance systems for personal health information. Additionally, the study highlights existing knowledge gaps and proposes six research avenues to achieve a deeper understanding of privacy in SHMSs.",,0,,,rev_synthesized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review paper of internal crowdsourcing is to provide conceptual development, synthesise the literature, and provide a research agenda. In the review reported in this paper, we systematically analysed and critically reviewed the literature in this domain published thus far (74 papers). We found useful findings and insights into a new and relevant IT-enabled phenomenon. At the same time, we also found conflicting definitions and conceptualisation, as well as research efforts that are not well integrated.
